LeoCardz Link Preview for Android
=================================

This a version for Android of my web [Facebook Link Preview](http://lab.leocardz.com/facebook-link-preview-php--jquery/ "Facebook Link Preview").

It makes a preview from an url, grabbing all informations. Such as title, relevant texts and images.

For more information about this, please access [Android Link Preview](http://android.leocardz.com/android-link-preview/ "Android Link Preview").

For a sample app, please install it from [Android Link Preview on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.leocardz.link.preview&feature=search_result "Android Link Preview on Google Play").

In this project, I have added some libs.

Note 1 - Required Libs: [jsoup](http://jsoup.org/ "jsoup") is a smart lib to crawl the htlm code. [UrlImageViewHelper](https://github.com/koush/UrlImageViewHelper "UrlImageViewHelper") is an optimized lib for url images.

Note 2 - Not Required Libs: Two libs for a more concise and uniform layout, which are [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/ "ActionBarSherlock") and [HoloEverywhere](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere "HoloEverywhere").
